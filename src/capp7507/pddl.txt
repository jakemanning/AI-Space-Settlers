CONSTANTS:
ships: ship1, ship2, ship3, ship4, ship5, ship6
powerups: extra ship, double energy, drone
LOCATIONS: 100 grid dots and any mineable asteroids, beacons, our bases, and their flags location/last location
RELATIONS: HasFlag(ship), At(ship, location), FlagScore, NumShips, NumResources, Energy(ship), Role(ship), MaxEnergy(ship)
possible roles: flag collector, flag returner, resource collector
ACTIONS: BuyPowerup(ship, powerup), GoTo(ship, location)

Initial state: FlagScore = 0, ~HasFlag(s), At(s, random dot), Energy(5000) for all s in ships
Goal state: FlagScore = 50, NumShips = 6, Energy(s) = 5000 for all s in ships

BuyPowerup(ship, powerup)
pre: enough resources to purchase ^ (powerup != drone v HasFlag(ship))
effect:
when powerup = extra ship : NumShips++ ^ NumResources--
when powerup = double energy : MaxEnergy(ship) * 2 ^ NumResources--
when powerup = drone : NumResources-- ^ FlagScore++

GoTo(ship, location)
pre:
((Role(ship) = flag collector ^ location = their flag ^ ~HasFlag(ship))
v (Role(ship) = flag returner ^ location = our base ^ HasFlag(ship))
v (Role(ship) = resource collector ^ location = a mineable asteroid ^ ~HasFlag(ship)))
^ (Energy(ship) > 1500 v location = beacon v location = our base)
effect:
Energy(ship) -= 1500 ^ At(ship, location) ^
when Role(ship) = flag collector : HasFlag(ship) ^ Role(ship) = flag returner
when Role(ship) = flag returner : ~HasFlag(ship) ^ FlagScore++
when Role(ship) = resource collector ^ location = mineable asteroid : NumResources++
when location = beacon : Energy(ship) += 2500
