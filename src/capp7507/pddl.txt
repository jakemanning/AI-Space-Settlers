constants: shipN, flag
Initial state: Waiter(ship1) ^ Waiter(ship2) ^ Waiter(ship3)

roles: flagger, miner, waiter, baseboy, thirstyboy, homesickboy

goal: FlagScore > 50, ShipCount = 6, CloseBases = 3, Energy(s) > 3000 for all s in ships

Thirsty(ship) means ship has less than some amount of energy (1500?)
Homesick(ship) means ship has greater than some amount of resources (5000?)
NextBaseBoy(ship) means we need a base boy and ship is the closest ship to the appropriate alcove
CloseBases returns the number of times a base boy has been deployed and dropped a base close to the target flag alcoves
