CONSTANTS:
ships: ship1, ship2, ship3, ...
flags: our flag, their flag
powerups: extra ship, double energy, drone
ai cores
LOCATIONS: 100 grid dots and any mineable asteroids, beacons, our bases, and their flags location/last location
RELATIONS: HasFlag(ship), At(ship, location), FlagScore, NumShips, NumResources, Energy(ship), Role(ship)
possible roles: flag collector, flag returner, resource collector
ACTIONS: BuyPowerup(ship, powerup), GoTo(ship, location)

Initial state: FlagScore = 0, ~HasFlag(s), At(s, random dot) for all s in ships
Goal state: FlagScore = 50, ~HasFlag(s)

BuyPowerup(ship, powerup)
pre: enough resources to purchase
effect:
when powerup = extra ship : NumShips++ ^ NumResources++
when powerup = double energy :

GoTo(ship, location)
pre:
((ship = flag collector ^ location = their flag ^ ~HasFlag(ship))
v (ship = flag returner ^ location = our base ^ HasFlag(ship))
v (ship = resource collector ^ location = a mineable asteroid ^ ~HasFlag(ship)))
^ (Energy(ship) > 1500 v location = beacon v location = our base)
effect:
Energy(ship)-- ^
when ship = flag collector : HasFlag(ship) ^ At(ship, location)
when ship = flag returner : ~HasFlag(ship) ^ At(ship, location) ^ FlagScore++
when ship = resource collector : At(ship, location) ^ NumResources++
